HW #4 README:

PROBLEM 3:
File problem3.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file. In order to run it, just press 'run all cells' at the top,
and it will go through and run all the code and produce the desired outputs.

To implement the neural network, I created a Layer class which implemented torch.nn.Module. Then, I created
a NN (NeuralNetwork) class which was comprised of layers. Then I constructed a model, and then trained it,
and then called my NN forward method in order to find it's predictions.

PROBLEM 4:
File problem4.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file. In order to run it, just press 'run all cells' at the top,
and it will go through and run all the code and produce the desired outputs.

This problem is separated into parts a,b,c, and I labelled them accordingly. 

In part a, I just graphed the original data, splitting it into different classes based on color.

In part b, I ran both linear and kernel svm on the testing data and graphed the results.

In part c, I ran my neural network from problem 3 on the data and graphed the results when I used
neural networks of different numbers of hidden layers and different number of neurons in each layer.
