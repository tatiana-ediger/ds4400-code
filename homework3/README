HW3 README:

The packages/imports used are:
    - import numpy as np
    - from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    - from scipy.io import loadmat
    - from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC

There are two python files included in my submission: logistic-regression.py and svm.py

The first file, logistic-regression, is my implementation of of Logistic Regression. In part a, I define a function that produces the w
and b values of the hyperplane that separates the data. In part b, I apply this function to the training and testing
datasets and find the classification errors for both. I also graphed all the data points as well as the line separating
the data. These graphs are the only two attachments generated from this code.
